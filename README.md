# Testing React Applications in Practice

> Read [in Russian](./docs/ru.md)

In this workshop, we will write a currency converter and cover it with tests. In the workshop, we will discuss how to:

- Extract and test business logic using pure functions;
- Divide the code into modules so that it's easy to test them;
- Apply different mock strategies, prepare stubs and test data;
- Test side-effects and React hooks;
- Work with asynchronous functions and test them;
- Connect third-party libraries via adapters for convenient testing.
